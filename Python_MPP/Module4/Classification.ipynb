    "# Applications of Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will perform **two-class classification** using **logistic regression**. A classifier is a machine learning model that separates the **label** into categories or **classes**. In other words, classification models are **supervised** machine learning models which predict a categorical label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The German Credit bank customer data is used to determine if a particular person is a good or bad credit risk. Thus, credit risk of the customer is the classes you must predict. In this case, the cost to the bank of issuing a loan to a bad risk customer is five times that of denying a loan to a good customer. This fact will become important when evaluating the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a linear model but with a nonlinear response. The response is binary, $\\{ 0,1 \\}$, or positive and negative. The response is the prediction of the category. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn the following: \n",
    "-  How to prepare data for classification models using scikit-learn. \n",
    "-  Constructing a classification model using scikit-learn.\n",
    "-  Evaluating the performance of the classification model. \n",
    "-  Using techniques such as reweighting the labels and changing the decision threshold to change the trade-off between false positive and false negative error rates. "

    "Logistic regression is widely used as a classification model. Logistic regression is linear model, with a binary response, `{False, True}` or `{0, 1}`. You can think of this response as having a Binomial distribution. For linear regression the response is just, well, linear. Logistic regression is a linear regression model with a nonlinear output. The response of the linear model is transformed or 'squashed' to values close to 0 and 1 using a **sigmoidal function**, also known as the **logistic function**. The result of this transformation is a response which is the log likelihood for each of the two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoidal or logistic function can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\kappa(x - x_0)}} \\\\\n",

So Bernoulli sampling (random guessing) with a probability $p$ for the positive case, will produce a ROC curve that runs diagonally from $0.0,0.0$ to $1.0,1.0$. The area under this triangular region is 0.5. It is often said that a classifier with an AUC of greater than 0.5 is better than random guessing.

    "2. Computed a logistic regression model. \n",
    "3. Evaluated the performance of the module using multiple metrics. It is clear that accuracy is not a particularly useful metric here. The naive 'classifier' produced accuracy that was only somewhat worse as a result of the class imbalance.  The confusion matrix and the precision, recall and F1 statistics gave meaningful measures of model performance, especially when considered together. \n",
    "4. Reweighted the labels and changed the decision threshold for the reweighted model. These steps helped overcome both the class imbalance problem and the asymmetric cost of misclassification to the bank. "
